## Secure Http Properties Connector

Among the various alternatives for securing your environment variables, a fundamental approach, without relying on a dedicated tool, is to store variables in property files. This method proves efficient and convenient during development. However, as you transition to production, several additional considerations come into play:
 - who can set the variables
 - who can see the variables
 - how to manage different environment variables in relation and coordiantion with each other
 - if a variable needed to be changed in a running env, then which approach would be the fastest and errorness
 - how to seperate variable management and project artifacts management (packages should not contain properties)
 - how to integration variable management with CI/CD
 - how can this be automated
 
One approach would be, without considering vault tools due to some reasons, putting those in one central place and serving thru here. To enhance the security of these sensitive artifacts at the network level, implementing access control lists (ACLs) would be beneficial.

Using ACLs ensures that properties can only be read within their respective environments.

To safeguard the values themselves, it is essential to encrypt them to prevent unauthorized access. In certain instances, non-production passwords, especially in development environments, may be kept less complex to expedite development. However, it is evident that production passwords should not follow the same approach. 

dev.properties file
```
billing.db.url=jdbc://devdb.local
billing.db.name=billing
billing.db.user=integration_user
billing.db.pass=devPass123
```

prod.properties file
```
billing.db.url=jdbc://proddb.local
billing.db.name=billing
billing.db.user=integration_user
billing.db.pass=![encrypted-prod-passw]
```

this connector decrypt literals which already encrypted. mule 3 already  has a connector for encryption for clear text.
//TODO extend this connector to encrypt clear text as well. 

## compile

```sh
mvn clean package -DskipTests
```

## add  to library
after getting the package ready, add thisas dependency to your application pom.xml

```xml
<dependency>
	<groupId>github.com.farukonder.mule4.connectors</groupId>
	<artifactId>secure-http-properties-connector</artifactId>
	<version>0.0.10</version>
	<classifier>mule-plugin</classifier>
</dependency>
```

## setup

mule projects mostly has a confix.xml for just configuration  but in any mule.xml adding connctor conf is enough
![connector-define](./content/connector-initiate.png)

with a small set of definitions
![connector-conf](./content/connector-conf.png)

## advanced setup

like location, key and algorithm also can be pull from CI/CD. in order to managed this below  can be the possible approach.


```xml
<global-property doc:name="Global Property" doc:id="69c8c29a-21fc-409e-a104-635334980abb" 
	name="env" value="qa" />
<global-property doc:name="Global Property" doc:id="ad915c98-1fca-4d46-86dc-06c19da8b3d9" 
	name="propertyUrl" value="https://get.my.property.local" />
<global-property doc:name="Global Property" doc:id="550ec493-6ce6-4141-a012-cb80b81b81s4" 
	name="key" value="super-secret" />
<global-property doc:name="Global Property" doc:id="5v0ec493-6ce6-4141-a012-zb8fb81b8143" 
	name="algorithm" value="Blowfish" />

<!-- lets use the connector after having env specific metadata-->	
<secure-http-properties:config doc:name="Http Properties Config" doc:id="0720a68d-e738-461e-a1a0-fd4c4ada9c32"
	name="Http_Properties_Config" 
	httpPath="${propertyUrl}" algorithm="${algorithm}" key="${key}">
```

## referencing to property

those properties can be referenced as usual

```xml
<db:config name="Database_Config_MSSQL"
	doc:name="Database Config"
	doc:id="499da03a-3c77-4d9d-83e4-59ab21774c5e">
	<db:generic-connection
		url="jdbc:sqlserver://${billing.db.url};databaseName=${billing.db.name};user=${billing.db.user};password=${billing.db.pass};encrypt=true;trustServerCertificate=true"
		driverClassName="com.microsoft.sqlserver.jdbc.SQLServerDriver" />
```

## publish

put below xml snipped in your pom.xml file. and run mvn deploy in order to put this jar to artifact repository

```xml
<distributionManagement>
	<repository>
		<id>repo-mule</id>
		<url>https://pkgs.dev.azure.com/$organization/$project/_packaging/cci-repo-mule/maven/v1</url>
	</repository>
	<snapshotRepository>
		<id>repo-mule</id>
		<url>https://pkgs.dev.azure.com/$organization/$project/_packaging/cci-repo-mule/maven/v1</url>
	</snapshotRepository>
</distributionManagement>
```

**know issues**
 - There's no XML files that has a <module> root element, thus is impossible to auto generate a [mule-artifact.json] descriptor file. The file must start with [module-] and end with [.xml], such as [module-foo.xml] 
 - - set JAVA_HOME to your env. in my case export JAVA_HOME=/Library/Java/JavaVirtualMachines/jdk1.8.0_301.jdk/Contents/Home# mule-log4m-connector
